# Sleep-Monitoring-System-Project
Classification Task for Sleep Quality Detection  
## Abstract
This study presents a wearable sleep monitoring system combining multimodal sensors and a lightweight neural network. It consists of STM32-based wrist and headbands for real-time collection of heart rate, SpOâ‚‚, temperature, and EEG signals. A compact model integrating ResNet, LSTM, and SE attention achieves 86.39% accuracy on the Sleep-EDF dataset. The accompanying software enables real-time display and sleep quality evaluation, offering a complete and practical solution for daily sleep health management.
